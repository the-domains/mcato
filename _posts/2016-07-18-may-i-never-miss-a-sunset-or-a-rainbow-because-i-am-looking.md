May I never miss a sunset or a rainbow because I am looking down.  
- Sara June Parker 

Over the next few days our department will complete two major efforts; all the work involved in supporting the opening of the Bridge for Laboratory Sciences, and the launch of the new Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. Both projects represent the culmination of literally thousands of hours of effort. Both projects are complicated and involved planning and coordination across a large community. As with any long effort, it can be tempting to get to the end and move right on to work on the next big thing...but I think that would be a mistake. 

Instead, I'd like to suggest that we pause and appreciate that both the Bridge and IAM represent significant strategic shifts for us and for our institution more broadly. 

The Bridge creates an array of physical spaces to bring multiple disciplinary perspectives together. That proximity can better support the collaborative and integrative scholarship that makes a Vassar education unique. Our initial contributions to the effort include the wired and wireless networking, classroom A/V, door locks and security cameras, and the long list of IT needs to get the individuals and labs moved in and operating again. 

The new IAM system automates an array of processes and workflows that up to now have required far more manual intervention to execute, manage and maintain. With this project we've also created a framework to better support the implementation of new and innovative services and solutions. Using that framework we'll shortly be bringing [Dropbox for Education][0] to campus and moving to implement [Eduroam][1] making it easier for our community to visit and work at other institutions and for us to host colleagues here.

More importantly though IAM creates the framework to better support collaborative projects both between individuals and teams on campus, and with colleagues and teams at institutions around the world. 

For those reasons I find it quite fitting that both projects are coming online in the same period. The Bridge provides physical spaces for collaboration, and IAM facilitates extending collaboration virtually. 

Among the long list of projects and tasks we're all working on, I believe these are two important rainbows that I'd encourage us all to not miss.

Have a great start to the week!
