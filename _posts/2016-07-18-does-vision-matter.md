  Over the last few years I've spent a lot of time exploring the idea of vision
  and mission statements and why do they matter to individuals and
  organizations. It's true that for far too many of us, these statements haven't
  been anywhere near as helpful to us as they could and should be. Yet when I
  study companies such as Apple, especially under Steve Jobs, with a singular
  focus of developing a 'computer for the rest of us', I start to suspect that a
  well articulated vision can significantly change a company. Some of my other
  favorite examples, Southwest Airlines, Zappos and Uber, all have used their
  vision statements to clarify what they are all about and help resolve
  decisions about what to do next. In short, I think vision matters...a great
  deal.

Over the last few years I've spent a lot of time exploring the idea of vision and mission statements and why do they matter to individuals and organizations. It's true that for far too many of us, these statements haven't been anywhere near as helpful to us as they could and should be. Yet when I study companies such as Apple, especially under Steve Jobs, with a singular focus of developing a '[computer for the rest of us][0]', I start to suspect that a well articulated vision can significantly change a company. Some of my other favorite examples, Southwest Airlines, Zappos and Uber, all have used their vision statements to clarify what they are all about and help resolve decisions about what to do next. In short, I think vision matters...a great deal.

Over the next few months I'll be working first with the Directors, and ultimately with all of CIS, to develop and articulate a shared vision for what we can and should be to best serve the Vassar community. We have a history of successes to build from, but it's clear that the technologies, approaches and opportunities we face are radically different than we've ever seen before. I'm excited to work through this process with all of you and invite you to spend time considering what it is that excites you about your work here, and how you think we can best serve the College as a collective team.
