I read a series of New Year's quotes over the last few days and this one stood out: 

Tomorrow is the first blank page of a 365 page book. Write a good one.   
-Brad Paisley 

The idea that the year ahead is a blank book reminds me that I can't really imagine what it will mean for us to build on all we accomplished in 2015\. All I can do is do my best to be open to the ideas, suggestions, and yes corrective/negative feedback that I'll encounter along the way. 

Even though the time away has been wonderful, I'm excited to return to campus and see just what our book of 2016 turns out to be!
