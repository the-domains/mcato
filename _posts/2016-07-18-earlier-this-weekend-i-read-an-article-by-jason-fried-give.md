  Earlier this weekend I read an article by Jason Fried, "Give it 5 Minutes”.
  The article explores the concept that ideas, even great ideas, are initially
  fragile. That they can easily be missed or dismissed altogether. That it takes
  intention on most of our parts to truly consider ideas that are a departure
  from the norm. That sitting with new ideas, actually considering them before
  picking them apart, could be a more fruitful, but admittedly difficult
  practice to nurture.

Earlier this weekend I read an article by Jason Fried, "Give it 5 Minutes". The article explores the concept that ideas, even great ideas, are initially fragile. That they can easily be missed or dismissed altogether. That it takes intention on most of our parts to truly consider ideas that are a departure from the norm. That sitting with new ideas, actually considering them before picking them apart, could be a more fruitful, but admittedly difficult practice to nurture. 

Here's a quote from the article:

Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn't involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That's easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea.

Reading the article I reflected on a lot of our recent work in our organization. Whether it's the new Service Desk location, the Research & Education Network relationships, or the IAM project, much of what we're doing started as an idea with a small group of people, sometimes from one individual. One of our Directors had worked up a drawing of a consolidated Service Desk with a few members of their team years before it was possible. The need for a new IAM system began for me at Vassar with my very first conversation with our Database Administrator, and the work the team did last week to stabilize the system benefited from a number of 'what if we tried this' ideas.

I'm beginning the week mulling this part over:

So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it's too hard or it's too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.

Interestingly, I've been approached with a couple of 'I know this might sound like a crazy idea, but...' conversations over the last few weeks. I'm looking forward to putting this approach to the test.
