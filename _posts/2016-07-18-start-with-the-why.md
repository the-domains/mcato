  A few weeks ago I watched a TedTalk by Simon Sinek titled ‘How great leaders
  inspire action’. In short, he argues that the big difference that sets apart
  people like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and the Wright Brothers, and
  organizations like Apple, is that they focus on the Why of their work. Their
  process is Why, then How, and then What. Further, he asserts, this is
  diametrically opposed to the approach that most of us take, we first focus on
  the What. More like this; What, then How and then Why.

A few weeks ago I watched a TedTalk by Simon Sinek titled '[How great leaders inspire action][0]'. In short, he argues that the big difference that sets apart people like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and the Wright Brothers, and organizations like Apple, is that they focus on the Why of their work. Their process is Why, then How, and then What. Further, he asserts, this is diametrically opposed to the approach that most of us take, we first focus on the What. More like this; What, then How and then Why.

I was really struck by the simplicity of this assertion, but also by the realization that I don't do this often enough. 

Ironically, a few days later I had the opportunity to test the approach in a presentation on Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Single Sign-on (SSO) at this semester's first Faculty Meeting. Keep in mind we've been talking about IAM for at least two years, the [IAM website][1] has been live for at least eight months, we've had two open campus conversations and articles in the [Misc][2], the [Science at Vassar][3] website, and the [Alumnae Quarterly][4]. Yet, ahead of the presentation I received a list of questions reflecting a number of basic misunderstandings and incorrect assumptions about what these efforts include and the risks they entail.

So I gave it a try. This time I started with the Why of the IAM project '_...to facilitate distributed scientific research collaborations_', and shared the four project goals that build on this statement. From there we talked about the How, including sharing information about some of the new services that are enabled by the project, including the [eduroam][5] wireless service, [Internet2][6], and the [Incommon Federation][7]. Ironically, I never got around to talking about What IAM actually is...and I don't think that's a bad thing.

The really revealing thing for me is that speaking to the Why of IAM seemed to really resonate. Even colleagues who still can't explain what IAM is are now commenting on the benefits and are excited about them. In short, the Why seems to matter much more to them.

Here's another example. This past Monday a team member facilitated a Lessons Learned debrief with the IAM project team. We touched on this concept and started asking how could we have used the idea more throughout the project. Specifically, would the IAM project have benefited if we explicitly talked about the Why of the overall project at the very beginning of each and every meeting? Could it have changed the way we talked about the efforts if we kept the faculty research benefit front and center? Would our communication to campus have been different? If so, how?

Now I keep thinking, how else could we make use of this idea? Could it improve the project proposal process? Could it enhance the way we communicate to campus...and within our organization? Would our meetings be more meaningful if we explicitly talked about the Why of our agenda topics? Would our purchase requests be easier to process if the Why was clearly stated? Would decisions about professional development, travel, office space, you name it, would all of them make a lot more sense if we built a practice of asking each other to articulate the Why?

What do you think?
