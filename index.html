Their process is Why, then How, and then What. Further, he asserts, this is diametrically opposed to the approach that most of us take, we first focus on the What.

That it takes intention on most of our parts to truly consider ideas that are a departure from the norm. That sitting with new ideas, actually considering them before picking them apart, could be a more fruitful, but admittedly difficult practice to nurture. </p></div><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="39"><p>Here's a quote from the article:</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-f908f540-9f71-411b-8f3a-25a932416efc" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="40"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="42"><a class=" " href="may-i-never-miss-a-sunset-or-a-rainbow-because-i-am-looking" data-reactid="43"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="44"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="45"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0c9b332b6123ecf8ded5d966b299e8f1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F2c741e3d432aab03bd839386dcc46de7%2Fcroprotate.jpg%3Fcropheight%3D1964%26cropwidth%3D3802%26degrees%3D0%26input%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252F8aa85286-3397-43a0-8fe6-65d72c7c2d47.jpg%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:58.251953125% 74.8627641293279%;" data-reactid="46"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c946cc51a66befcc52adfd1a984b1817/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F2c741e3d432aab03bd839386dcc46de7%2Fcroprotate.jpg%3Fcropheight%3D1964%26cropwidth%3D3802%26degrees%3D0%26input%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252F8aa85286-3397-43a0-8fe6-65d72c7c2d47.jpg%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:58.251953125% 74.8627641293279%;" data-reactid="47"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/bfa7bd3cb7a9b2238161a2b542966cf6/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F2c741e3d432aab03bd839386dcc46de7%2Fcroprotate.jpg%3Fcropheight%3D1964%26cropwidth%3D3802%26degrees%3D0%26input%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252F8aa85286-3397-43a0-8fe6-65d72c7c2d47.jpg%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&amp;width=720" style="object-position:58.251953125% 74.8627641293279%;" data-reactid="48"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c267ad46a08f0d6e9deba27a9bff0c77/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F2c741e3d432aab03bd839386dcc46de7%2Fcroprotate.jpg%3Fcropheight%3D1964%26cropwidth%3D3802%26degrees%3D0%26input%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252F8aa85286-3397-43a0-8fe6-65d72c7c2d47.jpg%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&amp;width=360" style="object-position:58.251953125% 74.8627641293279%;" data-reactid="49"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="3802" data-height="1964" data-ratio="1.9358452138492872" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0c9b332b6123ecf8ded5d966b299e8f1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F2c741e3d432aab03bd839386dcc46de7%2Fcroprotate.jpg%3Fcropheight%3D1964%26cropwidth%3D3802%26degrees%3D0%26input%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252F8aa85286-3397-43a0-8fe6-65d72c7c2d47.jpg%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:58.251953125% 74.8627641293279%;" data-reactid="50"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="51"><!-- react-empty: 52 --><!-- react-empty: 53 --><!-- react-empty: 54 --><!-- react-empty: 55 --><!-- react-empty: 56 --><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="57"><p>May I never miss a sunset or a rainbow because I am looking down.<br>- Sara June Parker </p></div><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="58"><p>Over the next few days our department will complete two major efforts; all the work involved in supporting the opening of the Bridge for Laboratory Sciences, and the launch of the new Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.

</picture><p>Over the last few years I've spent a lot of time exploring the idea of vision and mission statements and why do they matter to individuals and organizations. It's true that for far too many of us, these statements haven't been anywhere near as helpful
    to us as they could and should be. Yet when I study companies such as Apple, especially under Steve Jobs, with a singular focus of developing a '<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.entrepreneur.com%2Farticle%2F197538&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfI-EANkAyUeICCum5y-z8MdXF9Xw">computer for the rest of us</a>',
    I start to suspect that a well articulated vision can significantly change a company. Some of my other favorite examples, Southwest Airlines, Zappos and Uber, all have used their vision statements to clarify what they are all about and help resolve
    decisions about what to do next. In short, I think vision matters...a great deal.</p><p>Over the next few months I'll be working first with the Directors, and ultimately with all of CIS, to develop and articulate a shared vision for what we can and should be to best serve the Vassar community. We have a history of successes to build from,
    but it's clear that the technologies, approaches and opportunities we face are radically different than we've ever seen before. I'm excited to work through this process with all of you and invite you to spend time considering what it is that excites
    you about your work here, and how you think we can best serve the College as a collective team.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="79"><!-- react-empty: 80 --></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="81"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="82"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="83"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="84"><span data-reactid="85"><!-- react-empty: 86 --><h2 data-reactid="87"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="88">Michael Cato</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="89"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="90"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="91"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

It's true that for far too many of us, these statements haven't been anywhere near as helpful to us as they could and should be. Yet when I study companies such as Apple, especially under Steve Jobs, with a singular focus of developing a 'computer for the rest of us', I start to suspect that a well articulated vision can significantly change a company. Some of my other favorite examples, Southwest Airlines, Zappos and Uber, all have used their vision statements to clarify what they are all about and help resolve decisions about what to do next. In short, I think vision matters...a great deal.","keywords":[]},"content":[{"id":"594a8bc7-6499-4f98-967d-4d3b8bf5899e","item":"57608e3b-f6fa-43ca-81c3-c70ac13e8c5d","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<picture>\n
